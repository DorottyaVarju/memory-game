If the 2 face-up cards are not a pair, then the cards are turned over by themselves. If the 2 face-up cards are a pair, then the cards disappear and blue frames appear in their places.

If all the pairs are found, all the blue frames disappear and a message appears. Afterwards the user can choose a topic and the number of cards to play again.
