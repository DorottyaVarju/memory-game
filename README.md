# Memory Games

Try it out: https://dorottyavarju.github.io/memory-game/

This web application provides memory games on different topics. On the main page there is a menu, from where the user can choose the topic that is likeable for her/him.

After the user chose the wanted topic, she/he can choose the number of cards.

For example, on the next screenshot the topic is animal and the number of cards is 16.

By clicking on the cards the user can't turn more than 2 cards over at once.

If the 2 face-up cards are not a pair, then the cards are turned over by themselves. If the 2 face-up cards are a pair, then the cards disappear and blue frames appear in their places.

If all the pairs are found, all the blue frames disappear and a message appears. Afterwards the user can choose a topic and the number of cards to play again.
